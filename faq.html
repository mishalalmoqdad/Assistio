                <h2>3. Do you charge a setup fee?</h2>

                <h2>4. Who is Assistio for?</h2>
                <p>
                    Assistio is built for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service businesses (clinics, agencies, real estate, restaurants, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Online businesses that receive many repetitive questions.</li>
                    <li>Teams that want faster responses without building a big support team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you want one system to handle first-line support and lead qualification across multiple channels,
                    Assistio is designed for you.

                <h2>6. How long does it take to go live?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most clients can go live in a few days, depending on how fast we receive your content.
                </p>
                <p>A typical setup process looks like this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We have a short call to understand your business and main use cases.</li>
                    <li>You share your existing FAQs, documentation, and links.</li>

                <h2>7. Do I need to write code or manage the AI myself?</h2>
                <p>
                    No. We handle the technical integrations and AI configuration for you.
                    You only need to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Approve the answers and flows.</li>
                    <li>Tell us what to prioritize (sales, support, booking, etc.).</li>

                <h2>8. What happens if the AI doesn’t know the answer?</h2>
                <p>
                    When the AI is not confident, or when a customer asks to speak to a human, Assistio:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stops trying to guess the answer.</li>
                    <li>Escalates the conversation to your chosen channel (email, WhatsApp, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Sends the full conversation history so your team has context.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Your human team can then reply directly, and the user stays in the same channel.

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>9. Can I see what the AI is replying?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes. You can review:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conversation history by channel (chat, WhatsApp, email, Instagram, Facebook).</li>
                    <li>Messages where the AI handled the case.</li>
                    <li>Messages where a human stepped in.</li>
