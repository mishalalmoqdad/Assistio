            <h2>3. Legal bases for processing (EU/EEA or UK)</h2>
            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, we process your personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> when we need to provide services you requested or fulfill our agreement with you.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> for example, to improve our services, prevent fraud, or secure our systems, where these interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (e.g. certain marketing communications or optional cookies), we rely on your consent. You can withdraw it at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> where we are required to keep certain records or share information with authorities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
            <p>
                Our website may use cookies and similar technologies to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the website functions properly.</li>
                <li>Remember your preferences.</li>
                <li>Analyze how visitors use the site (e.g. via analytics tools).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some parts of the website may not function correctly
                if you disable cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we use third-party analytics or tracking tools, they may set their own cookies in accordance with their
                privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h2>5. How we share information</h2>
            <p>We may share your information with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third parties that help us operate our website and services (e.g. hosting providers, analytics services, email providers, payment processors).</li>
                <li><strong>Professional advisors:</strong> such as lawyers, accountants, or auditors when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Authorities:</strong> when we are legally required to do so or to protect our legal rights, users, or the public.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we work with service providers, we require them to only use your data to provide services to us and to
                protect your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we ever sell, merge, or restructure our business, your information may be transferred as part of that
                transaction. We will take steps to ensure your rights remain protected.
            </p>

            <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on where you are located and where our service providers are based, your information may be
                transferred and processed in countries outside of your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where required by law, we will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international
                transfers (for example, using standard contractual clauses approved by regulators).
            </p>

            <h2>7. How we protect your information</h2>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against loss,
                misuse, and unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, no system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of information transmitted over the
                internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our service, we may use reputable third-party infrastructure and AI providers. We choose providers
                that implement strong security practices and configure services with privacy and security in mind.
            </p>

            <h2>8. How long we keep your information</h2>
            <p>
                We keep your information only as long as necessary to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide our services and operate our business.</li>
                <li>Comply with legal and accounting obligations.</li>
                <li>Resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we no longer need your information, we will delete or anonymize it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a customer and you cancel your account, we may retain limited information as required by law or
                for legitimate business purposes (for example, invoices and basic account records).
            </p>

            <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to access and receive a copy of your data.</li>
                <li>The right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
                <li>The right to delete your data (subject to certain exceptions).</li>
                <li>The right to object to certain types of processing or request restriction.</li>

                <li>The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
            </ul>

                before responding.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in the EU/EEA or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
                authority.
            </p>
